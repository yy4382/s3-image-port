# Getting Started

Before using the application, you need to configure your S3 settings in the Settings tab. Required fields include the S3 endpoint, bucket name, region, and two keys (access key and secret key). Optional advanced settings like setting a public URL format are available if your S3 bucket uses a custom domain.

A step by step guide on how to configure your S3 settings if you are using Cloudflare R2 is available in the [Step-By-Step Guide for Cloudflare R2](/guide/for-cloudflare-r2).
